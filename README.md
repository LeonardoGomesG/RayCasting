# RayCasting

IME project to create an sphere image using Ray Cast and Phong reflexion model.

Students: 
Leonardo Gomes
Felipe Reyel

3 Images were produced with a fixed camera position and white light, changing the light position and object's ambient, diffuse and specular components.

## Ball_1: Lambertian Green image
Light:
position: (5, 5, 5);

object: (Green lambertian)
ambient: (0, 0.1, 0)
diffuse: (0, 0.7, 0)
specular: (0, 0, 0)

## Ball_2: Specular Red
Light:
position: (-3, 0, 5);

object: (red ks=0.8)
ambient: (0.1, 0, 0)
diffuse: (0.7, 0, 0)
specular: (0.8, 0.8, 0.8)

## Ball_3: Magenta, Gray background
Light:
position: (5, 5, 5);

object: (Magenta ks=1 gray background)
ambient: (0.1, 0, 0.1)
diffuse: (0.7, 0, 0.7)
specular: (1, 1, 1)
